### Requirements

- Morrowind
- Tribunal
- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

The Dwemer Teleportation Box mesh requires the Morrowind Code Path - Reflect fix to be enabled.

### Description

Once again delve into the depths of Arkngthand to find a Dwemer Teleportation Box, a tool that teleports you to the closest Dwemer ruin when equipped. It functions similarly to the vanilla intervention spells, but it takes you to a Dwemer ruin instead. The box can be found on top of the last chest in the deepest area of the ruin, Arkngthand. The Dwemer Teleportation Box will not teleport you to ruins within the Ghostfence.

If you are interested in adding compatibility for another mod, you need only place the "OJ_DTB_DwemerMarker" object at the appropriate locations and this mod will automatically find them. This mod may conflict with mods that heavily modify the exteriors of vanilla Dwemer ruins.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW.
