Better Buoyancy
By: OperatorJack


===Requirements===
- Morrowind
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod. 

===Description===
This mod adds new controls for swimming and levitating. Use the jump key to float upwards, and the sneak key to sink downwards. Levitation speed is directly tied to the magnitude of the spell. Swimming speed is based on a combination of encumbrance, athletics, acrobatics, and agility.

Each control set can be enabled or disabled in the MCM.

This mod does not use an ESP. This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

===Permissions===
MWSE-Lua code may be used for any purpose for Morrowind. Please do not use it for other games. Please credit OperatorJack as the original author of any code.

===Installation===
Use a mod management tool to install the mod.

===Removal===
