This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

====Description====
This mod adds a miniquest to unlock a new spell, "Teleport to Astral Pocket". When you cast the spell, you will be teleported to a new location known as the Astral Pocket. Herein, you'll follow the very brief story of a Telvanni wizard and lay claim to his housepod. 
Then, you can teleport back to your previous location in a very similar way to mark-recall spells.

To begin the miniquest, talk to your local bookseller about the latest rumours, or look for the text "Astrological Elements."

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

====Permissions====

This mod may be utilized for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author. It may not be used for other games.

====Installation====

Copy the MWSE folder and ESP into your Data Files folder.

====Removal====

Delete the mod's mwse folder and remove the ESP from your Data Files folder.
