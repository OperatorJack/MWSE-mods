Realistic Sun Damage

By: OperatorJack

====Requirements====
- Morrowind
- Tribunal
- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

====Description====
This mod adds a +/- 50% randomization to the sun damage calculation. It doesn't make sense that sun damage is a constant value, as clouds and coverage can change. It does not modify the sun damage formula in any other way.

I made this mod to showcase usage of a new feature I made in MWSE. I do not intend to expand the functionality in any way beyond what is currently offered.
This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

====Permissions====
This mod may be utilised for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author, except as described below. It may not be used for other games.

====Conflicts====
None.

====Installation & Removal====
Installation:
Copy the mod contents to your Data Files directory or use a mod installer.

Removal:
Uninstall this mod using your mod management tool or delete the mod contents from your Data Files directory.
