### Description

Serulius Vorenus is a militant and zealous member of the Imperial Cult in the world of Morrowind. Clad in intricately detailed, silver-trimmed Imperial armor, his most striking feature is the blood-stained blindfold he wears over his eyes. Beneath it, his eyes are lost to darkness, a sacrifice he made in devotion to the gods he serves. Across his back, the legendary sword "Bringer of Salvation" is strapped, its metal gleaming with the essence of molten lava, its blade eternally ablaze with divine fire.

This mod adds a new NPC, Serulius Vorenus, who wields a new artefact known as "Bringer of Salvation." This sword is a two-handed blade on par with the most powerful of artefacts, befitting its status as the blade of salvation. The sword has stats similar to a daedric claymore and a fire damage enchantment. Serulius Vorenus carries the sword on him and can be found in the Ebonheart Imperial Chapels, but he will not part with his famed blade without a fight. Warning: he is a true & powerful servant of Stendarr. Vorenus has some dialogue to help him blend into his new environment.

Ultimately, this mod is a modder's resource. Serulius Vorenus is mainly there to provide people a way to access the sword in-game.
