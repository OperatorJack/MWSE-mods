Skyrim Inspired Magic and Hit Chances

By: OperatorJack


====Requirements====
- Morrowind
- Tribunal
- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

====Description====
This mod makes all hit and magic chance calculations succeed. This means all spells will work if you have the magicka to cast them, and all hits will land on your target. 

This also applies to NPCs.

This mod will not update the UI elements to show the new cast chances. Just know that if you have the magicka to cast it, it'll work.
This mod will conflict with other mods that alter the hit and cast chances.
This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.
This mod is SUPER serious.

====Permissions====
This mod may be utilized for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author. It may not be used for other games.

====Installation====
Copy the MWSE folder into your Data Files folder.

====Removal====
Delete the mod's mwse folder from your Data Files folder.
