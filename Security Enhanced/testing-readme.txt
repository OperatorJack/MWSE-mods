Thanks for testing my mod!

I would recommend looking at the MCM options first before attempting to do anything else. 
You'll notice there are 2 additional options for "On Break" events. Please leave these off. These are for additional functionality that is not 
currently implemented and may not be released, but I did not want to remove it just yet. They will not affect your game.

By default, Debug Mode is set to On. You can turn this to Off to disable all message boxes from this mod. Play around with the other settings and see what you can break!

Please send me any comments you have, including:
- errors or unexpected behaviour
- ideas for additional improvement
- experience using the mod (did it make stealing things easier?..)
- any other thoughts you may have

Thanks for your help,
OperatorJack
