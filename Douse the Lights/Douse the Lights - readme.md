### Requirements

- Morrowind
- MWSE 2.1+

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

### Description

Channel your inner Thief and douse light sources with your bow, crossbow, or thrown weapons. Hitting a light source (or very nearby it) will turn off the light, and attempt to remove the flame from the ligt (may not work for some meshes that don't follow standard conventions). You can shoot guards to blow out their torches. You can shoot lanterns to blow out their flames. You can even shoot fires to douse them. The lights will naturally return after some time, and always return after you restart your game.

This may not remove some environmental lights, which are invisible lights that do not have visible objects, like lanterns or torches do. Due to Morrowind's collision system, it is possible you may "hit" a light and nothing happens. Try to hit it from a different angle and the effect will work as intended.

This mod does not use or require an ESP.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW.
