====Description====
This mod adds new Oblivion-inspired visual effects and mechanics for the vanilla detection magic effects, as well as adds 7 new magic effects. It integrates those effects into new spells and distributes them in-game to spell vendors. It does all of this without requiring an ESP. 

The following vanilla magic effects now have new visual effects and mechanics:
- Detect Animal
- Detect Enchantment
- Detect Key

The following new magic effects use the new visual effects and mechanics:
- Detect Automaton
- Detect Daedra
- Detect Door
- Detect Door
- Detect Humanoid
- Detect Trap
- Detect Undead

Each of these magic effects have the following new mechanic. Whenever you cast a spell containing the detection effect, the type for the effect will be looked for, using the magnitude (distance) of the spell effect. 
If the type (automaton, daedra, door, etc.,) is found, the new visual effects are shown for them. If the move out of range of the spell, you change cells, or some number of other things happens, the visual effect is removed. 
For example, if you cast a spell containing "Detect Key", any keys within range of the spell will now have the new visual effects attached to them! Depending on the spell effect, this can be useful in quests, looting, escaping dungeons, etc.

The new visual effects have unique properties. Each magic effect has its own visual effects. These visual effects (VFX) will show through walls, floors, and any other objects. These VFX are performance friendly and you should notice no FPS impact from this mod.

The new mechanics and VFX also apply to enchantments, powers, abilities, and any other magic-related scroll that uses the detection magic effects.

The new magic effects are available through the addition of over a dozen new spells. These spells are available at various vendors just like any vanilla spell would be. 

This mod is provided via a BAIN installer consisting of 3 components:
00 - Core
 * The base mod. This includes the new effects, spells, and VFX. This is required.
01 - Cast VFX
 * Additional VFX. This includes more VFX that replace the default Mysticism hit and casting VFX for the detection effects. This is optional.
02 - Alternate VFX
 * Alternative VFX. The VFX provided in 00 - Core may not work on some graphics cards. If you have this issue, experience a significant FPS drop, or just prefer a minimalist view, use these alternative VFX. This is optional.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.
