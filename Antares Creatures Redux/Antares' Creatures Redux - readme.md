# Antares' Creatures Redux

#### By Arcimaestro Antares, OperatorJack

## Description

In the 2000s-2010s, Arcimaestro Antares released a number of creature mods: Trolls, Treants, Frost Giants, Frost Monarch, Hill Giants, Green Slime, Medusa, Gargoyles, Cecaelia, and Beholder creature mods. These mods added exciting new creatures: a new Troll creature that turns to stone during the day, a tree that comes to life, a giant soldier of frost and ice, a dark-elf woman with the lower body of an octupus, a floating eye that beholds all, and more.

While the mods have generally held up well, the textures are lower resolution than MET or IT textures, and the ESPs contain some dirty references. Now, I cleaned the mods and upscaled the textures by 2x to help them better fit in with modern texture packs. Gigapixel 8 was utilized to perform the 2x upscale. These upscales have very few artifacts. I have also combined the mods into a single package, cleaned up several meshes, and created a combined ESP for all of the creatures.

List of Redux Changes:

- Used Gigapixel 8 to 2x upscale textures (see screenshots for comparison!)
- Converted textures to appropriate DDS formats.
- Cleaned dirty references, increasing mod compatibility.
- Packages all creatures into a single mod.
- Created combined ESP for all creatures.

For the latest updates, check the Nexus mods page for this mod or visit my GitHub: https://github.com/OperatorJack/MWSE-mods.

This mod was made as part of the 2025 Winter Modjam.

## Trolls

From Arcimaestro Antares description of the mod:

> "Horrid carnivores, man-eaters that know no fear. They are evil, stupid, with crude habits.
> They are sometimes described as turning to stone upon contact with sunlight and able to regenerate."
>
> Falx Carius, Captain of the imperial guards at Fort Frostmoth.

Adds a new Troll creature that turns to stone during the day. The trolls can be found only in the green areas of Solstheim and in some caves. When turned to stone, they can be attacked and destroyed with no risk.

## Treants

From Arcimaestro Antares description of the mod:

> "I've heard talk of the walking trees. This island holds many secrets it seems."
>
> Falx Carius, Captain of the Imperial Guards at Fort Frostmoth.

> "The tree spirits of this island. When the All-Maker breathed life into the creatures of the land, his breath blew through the trees as well. Some of these trees kept a part of this life, and these are the treants you see today."
>
> Korst Wind-Eye, Shaman of the Skaal Village

Adds a new creature, the Treant, in the Hirstaang Forest, Solstheim. When first encountered, they may be sleeping and look like other trees.

## Green Slime

Adds a new creature, the green slime, to the Lleran Ancestral Tomb (Ascadian Isles Region) and Falas Ancestral Tomb (West Gash Region). It looks like an inoffensive green pool of green mud. When approached, it rises and attacks. It attacks using its corrosive touch (a spell) that damages health, armor and weapons, and striking with the bones of its past victims.

It is immune to normal weapons, poison and paralysis, but very vulnerable to fire.

## Requirements

- Morrowind
- Bloodmoon
- Tribunal

## Installation

I encourage everyone to use a mod manager like Wrye Mash. Otherwise, unzip the files and drop the contents of each subfolder into your Data Files folder. Activate the combined ESP in the Morrowind launcher.

The archive contains these subfolders, which Wrye Mash will automatically locate for you:
00 - Trolls
01 - Treant
02 - Frost Giant
03 - Cecaelia
04 - Beholder
05 - Frost Monarch
06 - Gargoyles
07 - Green Slime
08 - Hill Giants
09 - Medusa
10 - Combined ESP

00-09 contain their respective mods. 10 contains the combined ESP which you can use in place of the ESPs in 00-09, if you are enabling all of the creature mods.
