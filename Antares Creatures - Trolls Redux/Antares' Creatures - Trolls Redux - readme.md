# Antares' Creatures - Trolls Redux

#### By Arcimaestro Antares, OperatorJack

## Description

In 2011, Arcimaestro Antares released Trolls!, a mod that adds a new Troll creature that turns to stone during the day. The trolls can be found only in the green areas of Solstheim and in some caves. When turned to stone, they can be attacked and destroyed with no risk.

While the mod has generally held up well, the textures are lower resolution than MET or IT textures, and the ESP contains some dirty references. Now, I cleaned the mod and upscaled the textures by 2x to help them better fit in with modern texture packs. Gigapixel 8 was utilized to perform the 2x upscale. These upscales have very few artifacts. While this redux isn't as large as some of my other redux mods, it helps bring a classic mod back to the forefront.

List of Redux Changes:

- Used Gigapixel 8 to 2x upscale textures (see screenshots for comparison!)
- Converted textures to appropriate DDS formats.
- Cleaned dirty references, increasing mod compatibility.

From Arcimaestro Antares description of the mod:

> "Horrid carnivores, man-eaters that know no fear. They are evil, stupid, with crude habits.
> They are sometimes described as turning to stone upon contact with sunlight and able to regenerate."
>
> Falx Carius, Captain of the imperial guards at Fort Frostmoth.
