Circinates
By: OperatorJack


==============
Requirements
==============
- Morrowind
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

==============
Description
==============
This mod is based on the circinates from TES: Arena.
https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Arena:The_Known_Spellbook

This mod makes it so that all spells have a circinate assigned based on the casting cost of the spell, similarly to TES: Arena. Circinates are in fact merely notional; you can be any level and purchase and cast any spell if you have the necessary spell points.

There are 8 tiers of circinates: 1st - 7th Circinate, and Arch-Circinate. The circinate is assigned based on the casting cost of the spell. The circinate is visible in the spell menu, but not in the spellmaking or spell vendor menus.

1st Circinate = 0 - 25
2nd Circinate = 25 - 50
3rd Circinate = 50 - 80
4th Circinate = 80 - 115
5th Circinate = 115 - 150
6th Circinate = 150 - 200
7th Circinate = 200 - 300
Arch-Circinate = 300+

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.
