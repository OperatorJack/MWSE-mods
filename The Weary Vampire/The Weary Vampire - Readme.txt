Description
==============
This mod overhauls Drethan Ancestral Tomb, transforming it into a much larger location which can be used as a player home after completing the quest, "The Weary Vampire." The vanilla quest dialogue is untouched, but the redesign of the tomb adds new character to the weary vampire's actions through atmospheric storytelling. The tomb is now a home befitting an ancient vampire, including cattle, a butchery station, cooking station, water sources, cattle cells, a new ash pit area, and a new room for Marara to live in. See screenshots for more!

Note: The connecting cave Shalit and exterior of Drethan Ancestral Tomb are untouched for maximum compatability.
