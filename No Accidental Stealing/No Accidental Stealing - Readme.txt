No Accidental Stealing

By: OperatorJack


====Requirements====
- Morrowind
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

====Description====
You can no longer interact with owned items unless you are sneaking. This prevents you from accidentally picking up owned items, opening owned doors, or otherwise doing things that could interfere with owned property (owned beasts not included).

Doors and objects with scriptes attached are ignored.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

====Permissions====
This mod may be utilized for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author. It may not be used for other games.

====Installation====
Copy the MWSE folder into your Data Files folder.

====Removal====
Delete the mod's mwse folder from your Data Files folder.
