OperatorJack's Deleveler
By: OperatorJack


====Requirements====
- Morrowind
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

====Description====
This mod delevels all levelled lists. similarly to Abot's Deleveler. Whereas Abot's mod is a batch tool that requires manual use, this mod is automatic and requires no maintenance.

Simply install the mod, and all levelled lists will be deleveled. This includes vanilla lists, mod added lists, and lists added mid-playthrough. 

For mods that edit the same list, you still need to merge levelled lists using a list merging tool.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

====Permissions====
This mod may be utilized for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author. It may not be used for other games.

====Installation====
Use the provided BAIN installer in a mod management tool to install the desired components.

====Removal====
Use a mod management tool to remove any installed files from your mod directory.

====Credits====
