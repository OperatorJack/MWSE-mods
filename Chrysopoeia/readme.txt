This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

====Description====
This mod adds a miniquest to unlock a new spell, "Chrysopoeia". When you cast the spell, you will be able to select an item in your inventory to transmute into gold. 

The amount of gold you receive depends on your alteration and willpower levels. The spell has no magical cost, but is not free.

To begin the miniquest, talk to anyone about the latest rumours.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

====Permissions====

This mod may be utilized for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author. It may not be used for other games.

====Installation====

Copy the MWSE folder and ESP into your Data Files folder.

====Removal====

Delete the mod's mwse folder and remove the ESP from your Data Files folder.
