# Carnithus Armamentarium Redux

#### By Carnithus, OperatorJack

## Description

In 2005, Carnithus released the Carnithus' Armamentarium, a new storefront selling arms and armor for the evilist among us. Carnithus himself appears in the mod as the head merchant of the store, although there are several other characters. Each sells a unique assortment of "evil" weapons, armors, decorations, and more. To me, this mod is representative of the early 2000s goth-fantasy trend and is a staple in the "classics" of Morrowind modding. Unfortunately, it hasn't aged well. The original mod, even the complete edition, has compatability issues due to the store's location in Maar Gan, and even worse, the textures are shockingly low resolution. Many of the cuirasses, for example, are 256x256 pixels! Compared to the 1024x1024 or even 2048x2048 many play with now, Carnithus' work was left behind in a cloud of blurry dust.

Now, in 2025, I have revamped the mod to meet today's standards. This means upscaled textures, optimized meshes, improved lighting, UV Mapping fixes, and more. Unlike some of my other Redux mods, I have changed very little of the interior of the Armamentarium and tried to keep the original character of the mod intact. I encourage you to play the original--even if only to see the differences.

One of the most important changes in this Redux is the usage of Gigapixel 8 to upscale Carnithus' original textures. Gigapixel 8 was utilized to perform a 4x upscale, increasing the resolution of all textures in the mod so that they blend better with modern texture replacers like MET or IT. Unlike the 4x Ersgan upscales available on the Nexus, these upscales have very few artefacts and look, to me, like they were always this resolution.

To get started, look for a Drow in the Mournhold, Great Bazaar. He'll guide you to the Armamentarium.

List of Redux Changes:

- Used Gigapixel 8 to 4x upscale textures (see screenshots for comparison!)
- Relocated storefront from Maar Gan into new, interior cell.
- Updated the Drow in Mournhold to guide you to the new interior cell. It is not accessible otherwise.
- Improved some lighting, objects, etc.
- Cleaned references to Maar Gan & removed many dirty references, increasing mod compatability.
- Cleaned many meshes and textures to reduce technical issues in rendering.

From Carnithus' 2005 description of the mod:

> The only EVIL ARMOR MOD you will ever need ( besides my add-ons). Carnithus has become old and tired. Taking
> a break from looting and plundering, he has opened a shop in the Mournhold Bazaar (much to their distress) to sell his
> many items that he has collected over time. This MOD contains all of my previously released armor sets with new female
> versions, and beast variants for greaves to cover the ankle. There is armor, weapons, wings, skirts, neck wraps, clothes,
> skins, masks, jewelry, liquor, blood..a whole lot of stuff all for sale at a reasonable price by the man himself Carnithus
> who is Vampire friendly! There are other items as well like rugs, tapestries, statics, etc. that are not for sale, but
> included in the plug-in. The items here have no scripts or enchantments attached ( except for wing rings ) and have
> rebalanced stats that should allow for completely balanced game play. In other words they do not have the highest stats in

## Requirements

- Morrowind, Bloodmoon, Tribunal

## Installation

I encourage everyone to use a mod manager like Wrye Mash. Otherwise, unzip the files and drop into your Data Files folder. Activate the ESP in the Morrowind launcher.

## Permissions

All assets in this mod are free to use for Morrowind, provided appropriate credit is given and unless those assets are exempted in the original mod readmes. Carnithus originally requested that any mods using his work have the meshes / textures moved to other folders / renamed. I have moved all meshes & textures into subfolders to account for this.

## Credits

- Carnithus (Original)
  - original mod design
  - models and textures (using many available resources from that time)
  - see original readme for full details.
- OperatorJack (2022 revamp)

  - changes to original models and textures: cleaned texture paths, merged duplicate geometry, fixed UV tearing, and other technical improvements.
  - relocated the storefront into a new interior cell to prevent compatability issues & cleaned all references to Maar Gan.
  - upscaled textures 4x using Gigapixel 8
  - many other tweaks and change to bring the mod into current standards.

  And many, many others who's work helped Carnithus in his original mod.
