====Requirements====
- Morrowind
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

====Description====
Adds an MCM menu to apply a percentage modifier to all movement speeds, for all actors. The default value is 100%. Set it to 200% to go twice as fast, or 50% to go half as fast. Supports values 0% - 1000%

This effect stacks with any other speed modifier mods, so it can safely be used in combination with them.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

====Permissions====
This mod may be utilized for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author. It may not be used for other games.

====Installation====
Copy the MWSE folder into your Data Files folder.

====Removal====
Delete the mod's mwse folder from your Data Files folder.
