### Requirements
Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon

- MGE XE + MWSE 2.1+ Nightly
- Magicka Expanded - Base Package and Summoning Spell Pack
- (Optional) Creature Casting Animation Patch

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

This mod requires the magic framework, Magicka Expanded. The base package and summoning spell pack are required. The other spell packs are not required. This allows a much more stable and robust implementation of the spells used in the mod.

### Description
Dagoth Ur is no longer an attraction situated on top of a volcano. Now, you will have to navigate the remnants of a fortress from long ago, from a war between living Gods. This mod significantly overhauls the exterior and interior of Dagoth Ur, transforming it into a fortress befitting its legendary status in lore. No longer will you be able to destroy demigods with repetitive magic; dwemer technology will stay your hand. And, most importantly, no longer will the battle between the mortal and the immortal be as simple as Vivec claims it to be. High level ash creatures, including Ash Vampires and Ascended Sleepers, have received new mechanics, new spells, and new immersive functionality. The final fight with Dagoth Ur has been reimagined as a three stage fight: survive against a horde of oncoming enemies, face the resurrected and recalled heartwights, and finally, destroy the heart itself. 

This mod does not modify the vanilla heart or Dagoth Ur scripts. This means that the method of destroying Dagoth Ur has not changed, nor has any part of the quests involving the final fight.
