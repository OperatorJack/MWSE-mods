# The Eye of Ariisiss Redux

#### By Geonox, Master Sam, OperatorJack

## Description

In 2005, Geonox released the Eye of Ariisiss, an arid-desert inspired player home utilizing custom assets. Despite some technical issues with those assets, they had created a beautiful realm that was fairly novel within Morrowind. In 2010, Master Sam revisited this mod and expanded upon it with his "The Eye of Ariisiss Expansion." Now, in 2022, I have revamped the entire mod to meet today's standards, both from a technical and design perspective. This means _many_ new assets, optimized meshes and textures, improved lighting, UV Mapping fixes, and more. Through the inclusion of OAAB_Data, I have also expanded on the available items to (hopefully) further improve the design of the Eye of Ariisiss. Little of the original mod remains, but hopefully those of you that played the original will still see it's aesthetic and tone shine through. If not, I encourage you to play the original--even if only to see the differences.

To get started, look for a barrel in the Odai River, just outside of Balmora. You'll find something special inside. Equip it to begin.

From Master Sam's 2010 update of the Eye of Ariisiss:

> Geonox initally created the Eye of Ariisiss a while back (2005) and it remained one of my favourite house mods, despite the fact that there was little storage and room to move around... The original concept of a magical eye that transported you places within an arid/middle east setting was just seductive, and I feel that the house should be seen by a lot more people... Hopefully the new room and additional storage adds a whole new dimension of space without disrupting the original charm Geonox made.

## Installation

I encourage everyone to use a mod manager like Wrye Mash. Otherwise, unzip the files and drop into your Data Files folder. Activate the ESP in the Morrowind launcher.

## Permissions

All assets in this mod are free to use for Morrowind, provided appropriate credit is given and unless those assets are exempted in the original mod readmes.
