This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

====Description====
This mod makes it so that weapons with enchantments of Cast-On-Strike and Cast-On-Use types will work without hitting a target. Just swing your weapon and the enchantment will work as normal, sending a spell projectile towards your target.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.


====Permissions====
This mod may be utilised for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author, except as described below. It may not be used for other games.

====Conflicts====
This mod may conflict with mods that add new magic mechsnics, or alter existing. 
It is fully compatible with Magicka Expanded. 
I do not recommend using it with 4NM_Magic.

====Installation & Removal====
Installation:
Copy the mod contents to your Data Files directory or use a mod installer.

Removal:
Uninstall this mod using your mod management tool or delete the mod contents from your Data Files directory.
