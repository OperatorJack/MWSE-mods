====Requirements====

- Morrowind

- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

====Description====

"3E 421 â€” The Levitation Act is passed throughout the Empire, outlawing the use of levitation magic."

This mod makes it so that performing a levitation spell is illegal, as it is supposed to be according to the The Levitation Act. 
Performing a levitation spell or using a levitation enchantment and being caught while doing so will give you a bounty of 500 gold per levitation effect, per cast! 
However, like with other crimes, it is possible to cast a levitation spell and not get caught. Guards will respond similarly to as if you stole an item or attacked someone.
This functionality does not apply to NPCs and creatures.

This mod removes any spell containing the levitate effect from all Mages Guild, Fighters Guild, Imperial Cult, Imperial Legion and some other Empire-aligned faction members, 
including those addes by other mods. 

The Addon ESP will also remove any levitation potions and items from members of those factions, as well as their surrounding area. It also adds new dialogue to reflect the new enforcement of The Levitation Act.
The Addon ESP is optional.

MCM Configuration options:
1) General Settings
 - Set the bounty value that is applied to the player when a crime is committed.

2) Whitelisted Cells
 - Choose cells where using levitation does not trigger a crime. Major Telvanni settlements are whitelisted by default.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.
