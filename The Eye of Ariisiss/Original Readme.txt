1. IMPORTANT

The rocks in the tower can be very slippery. So watch out where you are walking.
Some rocks are a bit to high and need to be reached by jumping. Everyone can make
the jump, it doesn't mattter what level you are.

* A furnished expansion is now also available. To play the furnished version the
basic plugin, the eye of arriisiss v1.2 or higher is needed to play the expansion.
 
*****************************************************************

2. Installation

To play the plugin unzip all the files into ..\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind\Data Files
directory. 
Start morrowind, select data files and check Geonox_The_Eye_of_Ariisiss_V1.0.esp
Once you are in the game you can reach the house by equipping the Serraila stone.

*****************************************************************

3. Credits

All designs, models and textures are made by Geonox. The models are a modders free
resource but remember to give me proper credits for the models designs and textures,
also when a texture is recolored or models are retextured or modified with 3d software.

*****************************************************************

4. Fixed bugs

* The Texture Error is now fixed, v1.1 didn't seem to fix the problem but this version
  does
* The teleport script is now changed and tested in different shrines and teleport places
  These bugs should now be fixed:
  - Automaticly being teleported to the Ariisiss when loading or saving a game
  - Automaticly being teleported wile activating a shrine

* There could still be some bugs in the game if so feel free to contact me.

*****************************************************************

5. Mod help

Travelling to the house can only be done with the Serraila which can be found arround
Balmora in the Ordai river. 

*Where can I find this stone in the river?

The stone can be found near the entrance of Balmora. If you folow the Ordai out of Balmora
you will find a barrel floathing on the river. Inside you will find what you seek. The 
barrel floats just outside Balmora.

*How do I use the Eye of Ariisiss?

Stand right before the eye and point on one of the buttons just above the iris and activate
it. There are four buttons which will talke you to Ald-ruhn, Vivec, Balmora and Ebonheart.
