- MGE XE + MWSE 2.1+ Nightly

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

============
Description
============
Visit an old but familiar face to embark on a quest to discover an ancient enchanting tool, created by Galerion the Mystic, and unlock an entirely new enchanting mechanic. 

The quest, Galerion's Tools, is relatively short (depending on your game knowledge) but introduces a new enchanting tool and mechanic that allows you to extract souls
from enchanted items and return them to soul gems. Once you have the tool, you can simply equip it like a tong or hammer to activate the mechanic. Similarly to the Soultrap
magic effect, you must have a soul gem of sufficient size to hold the soul. The mechanic uses a formula very similar to the vanilla enchanting formula and takes into consideration
GMST settings, so it should be compatible with any balancing mods. When using the tool, you will see a list of enchanting objects that you can extract the soul from. While hovering 
over these objects, you will be able to see the success chance and enchantment size in the tooltip.

To get started, do one of the following:
- Having completed the Corprus Cure quest and be in good standing with Divayth Fyr, speak with Divayth Fyr.
- As an Officer or higher of the East Empire Company, speak with Canctunian Ponius at the Company Hall in Ebonheart, while having good disposition. (Initiates a secondary quest that works in parrallel to Galerion's Tools.)
- As a Master or higher of House Telvanni, speak with another Master or higher about the latest rumours, while having good disposition.
