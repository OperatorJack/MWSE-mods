Requirements
=============
Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon

- MGE XE + MWSE 2.1+ Nightly
- Magicka Expanded - Base Package and Lore Friendly Spell Pack
- Tamriel Data

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

This mod requires the magic framework, Magicka Expanded. The base package and lore friendly spell pack are required. The other spell packs are not required. This allows a much more stable and robust implementation of the spells used in the mod.

============
Description
============
Molag Mar has been re-imagined as a bastion from which the Buoyant Armigers can operate. The Molag Mar plaza is no longer open to the elements and any other nefarious actor that may decide to wander in: it has been redesigned as part of the Waistworks. 
The Waistworks are expanded with new NPCs, new locations, and new designs. 
The Canalworks now features an armoury and treasury, within which the Buoyant Armigers keep their arms and weapons, as well as some of of their most valuable relics. 
The Underworks have been significantly expanded and now represent a true challenge to navigate successfully. 

All of these changes culminate in a lore-friendly, fortified setting for a new quest line spanning 5 quests of increasing complexity and difficulty. From the investigation of the murder of someone's dear friend, to the manifestation of some of the most powerful Daedra in history, these quests will introduce you to new characters, innovative new magic effects, and more.

Created by the Team Voluptuous Velks: OperatorJack, Petethegoat, RedFurryDemon, Wolliebeebee.
