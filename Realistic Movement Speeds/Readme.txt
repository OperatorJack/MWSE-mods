- Morrowind
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

====Description====
This mod uses MWSE Lua to modify movement speeds when strafing or backpedaling so that they are more realistic. NPCs and player alike will no longer be able to fire volleys of arrows while running backwards to safety. Movement direction is now tactically important.
 
If you are strafing (moving to the left or right while facing forward), then movement speed will be decreased by 20%. 
If you are backpedaling (walking backwards while looking forwards), then movement speed will be decreased by 40%.

These changes automatically apply to the player and any NPCs / Creatures (modded or vanilla) without using a plugin or altering your savegame.

As of V1.1, you can configure the percentages in the included MCM.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

====Permissions====

This mod may be utilized for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author. It may not be used for other games.

====Installation====

Copy the MWSE folder into your Data Files folder.

====Removal====

Delete the mod's mwse folder from your Data Files folder.
