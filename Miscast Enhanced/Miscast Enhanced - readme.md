### Requirements

- Morrowind
- Tribunal
- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+
- Magicka Expanded Framework

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

This mod requires the Magicka Expanded base framework. You do not need the optional spell packs to use this mod.

### Description

Inspired by the Miscast mod from years ago, this mod adds consequences to casting spells that are beyond the caster's abilities. Now, whenever you fail to cast a spell, there is a 15% chance that one of the spell effects in the spell will trigger a miscast. When this happens, you will experience negative effects relative to the power of the magic effect that failed, as well as relative to the effects of the magic effect itself. For example, failing to cast Night Eye will now shroud you in darkness. Failing to cast levitation will cause you to float upwards into the sky like a balloon. For a full list of effects and their miscasts, see the document _Miscast Enhanced - effects_ in the mod archive.

Currently, all vanilla magic effects are covered. This will be expanded to include all Magicka Expanded magic effects after the modathan is finished. Magic effects that are not currently covered will use the default miscast for the effect's school of magic.

This mod does not use or require an ESP.

There is a mod configuration menu (MCM) you can use to disable messages that Miscast Enhanced will show, as well as to enable debug mode. Debug mode will cause the miscast chance to become 100%, triggering a miscast every time you fail to cast a spell.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW.
