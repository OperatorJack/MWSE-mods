This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

====Description====
This mod adds a 4th statistic bar to the player HUD, representing current encumbrance. The bar will automatically update as you add or drop items, active feather effects, etc. Additionally, when targeting an item in the game world, the bar will update to reflect your encumbrance if you were to pick that item up. This preview is not implemented for inventory windows, like containers or barter windows.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

====Permissions====
This mod may be utilized for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author. It may not be used for other games.

====Installation====
Copy the MWSE folder into your Data Files folder.

====Removal====
Delete the mod's mwse folder from your Data Files folder.

====Credits====
- Yacoby for the original old-school MWSE mod which inspired this one.
