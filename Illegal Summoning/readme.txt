This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE, as of August 21, 2019. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

====Description====
This mod makes it so that performing a summoning spell in a town or city is illegal, as it was originally intended to be. Performing a summoning spell and being caught while doing it will give you a bounty of 500 gold per summoning effect, per cast! If you cast a spell with 8 summoning effects, you will gain a bounty of 4000 gold. However, like with other crimes, it is possible to cast a summoning spell and not get caught. Guards will respond similarly to as if you stole an item or attacked someone.

This functionality applies to NPCs and creatures as well.

MCM Configuration options:
1) General Settings
 - Set the bounty value that is applied to the player when a crime is committed.
 - Set the distance at which guards will be called when an NPC performs an illegal summon.

2) Whitelisted NPCs
 - Choose NPCs that are allowed to cast summoning spells. Telvanni guards and certain high-ranking Telvanni Faction leaders are whitelisted by default.

3) Blacklisted Magic Effects
 - Choose any magic effects which will trigger a crime, even if the NPC is whitelisted. Future compatability with my upcoming Magic Framework is already included, blacklisting summoning spells for Ash creatures.

4) Whitelisted Magic Effects
 - Choose any magic effects which will never trigger a crime. Summon Ancestral Ghost is whitelisted by default.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.
