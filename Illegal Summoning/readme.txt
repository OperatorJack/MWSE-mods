This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

====Description====
This mod makes it so that performing a summoning spell in a town or city is illegal, as it was originally intended to be. Performing a summoning spell and being caught while doing it will give you a bounty of 500 gold per summoning effect, per cast! If you cast a spell with 8 summoning effects, you will gain a bounty of 4000 gold. However, like with other crimes, it is possible to cast a summoning spell and not get caught. Guards will respond similarly to as if you stole an item or attacked someone.

This functionality applies to NPCs and creatures as well.

The bounty value of 500 can be changed through a slider, to 0 - 10,000, in the provided MCM.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

====Permissions====

This mod may be utilized for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author. It may not be used for other games.

====Installation====

Copy the MWSE folder into your Data Files folder.

====Removal====

Delete the mod's mwse folder from your Data Files folder.
