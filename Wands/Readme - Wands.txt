Requirements
=============
Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon

- MGE XE + MWSE 2.1+ Nightly
- Magicka Expanded - Base Package (Framework Only)


This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

This mod requires the magic framework, Magicka Expanded. Only the framework portion is needed.

============
Description
============
This mod adds fully functional wands to Morrowind, as well as makes staves able to shoot projectiles like in later games! For those familiar with my mod Cast-On-Swing Enchantments, this is the same functionality. The main difference is that now it is limited to wands and staves, and there are new wands models to work with it.

These new wands are available: bonemold, wooden, mabrigash, telvanni, iron, steel, nordic, dwemer (3 variants), ebony (3 variants), orcish, daedric, silver, and stalhrim.

For each model, there is an unenchanted version and 1 or more enchanted versions, except for the daedric wand. All wands are added via levelled lists, so make sure to merge levelled lists before playing your game. Wand distribution is based on player level.

Use the MCM to enable / disable treating staves as wands, as well as make other weapons work as wands. Other mods can register their models as wands easily to expand the wand selection.

============
Permissions
============
Please do not redistribute the wand models without the permissions of the authors (see credits). 

Otherwise, this mod may be utilized for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author. It may not be used for other games.

=============
Installation
=============
Copy the package contents into your Data Files folder and enable the ESP in the Morrowind launcher. Alternatively, use a mod installation tool.

========
Removal
========
Delete the package contents from your Data Files folder and clean your savegame.
