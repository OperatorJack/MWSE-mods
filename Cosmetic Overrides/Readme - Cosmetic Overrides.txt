By: OperatorJack

==============
Requirements
==============
- Morrowind
- Tribunal
- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod. If your MWSE build is not from March 20, 2020 or newer, you will receive errors.

Description
==============
Adds the ability to use cosmetic overrides for clothing and armour. Cosmetic Overrides do not affect enchantments, stats, or other gameplay mechanics; they simply change what is rendered on the player.

To unlock an item as a cosmetic override, you have to equip it. After that, it will be stored in your save game as a cosmetic override option.

You can view and manage cosmetic overrides for clothing and armour in the MCM menu. Overrides are assigned per layer type and slot. Meaning, you can have both a shirt (clothing layer) and cuirass (armour layer) active at the same time. However, the override will not be shown if you do not have an item of that type equipped. So, if you have no cuirass equipped, the armor chest override will not be used.

Cosmetic Overrides for weapons, shields, rings, amulets, and belts are not currently supported due to various engine limitations. Support may be added in the future.
This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.
