# Cosmetic Overrides

#### By OperatorJack

## Requirements

- Morrowind
- MGE XE 0.18.0
- Latest MWSE

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod. If your MWSE build is not up-to-date, MWSE will notify you of the issue.

## Description

Adds the ability to use cosmetic overrides for clothing and armour. Cosmetic Overrides do not affect enchantments, stats, or other gameplay mechanics; they simply change what is shown on the player.

To unlock an item as a cosmetic override, you have to equip it at least once. The first time you equip the item, you'll be notified that it has been unlocked as an override. After that, it will be stored in your save game as a cosmetic override option.

You can view and manage cosmetic overrides for clothing and armour in the MCM menu. Overrides are assigned per layer type and slot. Meaning, you can have both a shirt (clothing layer) and cuirass (armour layer) active at the same time. However, the override will not be shown if you do not have an item of that type equipped. So, if you have no cuirass equipped, the armor chest override will not be used.

You may disable the unlock notifications in the MCM, as well as enable the debugging logger. Notifications are on by default and logging is disabled by default.

Cosmetic Overrides for weapons, shields, rings, amulets, and belts are not currently supported due to various engine limitations. Support may be added in the future.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW. Anyone is welcome to write a OpenMW version and I will upload or link it here.
