### Requirements

- Morrowind
- Tribunal
- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+
- Magicka Expanded Framework

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

This mod requires the Magicka Expanded base framework. You do not need the optional spell packs to use this mod.

### Description

Tarhiel has long dreamed of reaching the sun. Save him from his perilous experiments with the Scrolls of Icarian Flight to go on a quest to unlock a completely new kind of levitation magic: flotation.

If Tarhiel has already died in your game, you can resurrect him without any issues to do the quest. Make sure to do so in his original location. This mod modifies his acrobatics level to be 125, so that fall damage will not apply to him. This means that in new games, he will not die from his first fall. Additionally, his standard greeting is deleted to allow for quest dialogue, as it overrides all other greetings.

Some parts of the quest disable player controls for a few seconds. Do not save or exit the game while controls are disabled to prevent issues in the quest cutscenes. At most, they last 5 seconds.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW.
