Description
============
Adds a D&D style Bag of Holding to the game. The bag has a constant weight of 15. The bag can hold a constant weight of 500. The bag is owned by Divayth Fyr, and you can find it in the Tower of Tel Fyr. 

Since this mod is lua-based, it should be more stable than mwscript or traditional mwse alternatives.

This mod will NOT work with OpenMW, atleast until support for MWSE is added to OpenMW.

Permissions
============
Any part of this mod can be used for anything related to Morrowind, without contacting me. Please credit me as the original author.
